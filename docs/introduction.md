# Welcome to my site

I created this site so that I could display all my current and past projects in one place, and also provide documentation for the same. The projects I did before I built this portfolio site did not have really good written documentation. 



## About myself 👦

Hi, this is me. I am from India and I like linux, open-source, the web, and hardware.

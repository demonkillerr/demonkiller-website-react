# Welcome to my site

I created this site so that I could display all my current and past projects in one place, and also provide documentation for the same. The projects I did before I built this portfolio site did not have really good written documentation. 

:::info

I provided video tutorials for ALG for example

## About myself üë¶

:::note

This page is going to sound a lot like a _resume_, because I intend it to be that way. It's meant for passing by recruiters.

:::caution

Some of the content I have written here might be childish/immature. This version of the site is not for production yet, and still requires alot of revision (in the content).

I am 21 y/o undergrad student, who is passionate about learning how things work in the space of technology. I like to tinker with hardware, and open-source software. I found coding interesting at the age of 13. My school had C programming in grade 8th and I was blown away by the fact that I could make a computer work on my commands (maybe a really bad way to put it, but I really liked the basic stuff we were taught, conditionals, loops, etc). 

I also enjoyed making my own website with HTML (we had HTML in grade 7th). It was nothing fancy, just a very plain looking page running locally, with my photos, some text like these, and many different links (to other HTML pages I made, regarding other stuff, such as hobbies.)

I undertook computer science as a major in junior college (grade 11th & 12th), and did pretty well there. We had C++ (procedural) in grade 11th and the **Object Oriented** paradigm in grade 12th. I also joined a programming class at AppTech. There is a back story as to how it all transpired (maybe I'll cover it in a blog), but basically that's where I learned most of my C++, that mattered.

I had to take up electronics engineering in college (damned CET scores, another story, will be covered in the blogs). This is the time I thaught I had to let go computer science for a while, I was interested in stuff like VLSI, SBCs, etc, but I saw myself loosing interest in it very quickly and I kept coming back to coding.

So, here I am in my final year of Engineering as I write this (I have had another static HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, website in the past). I intend on making this site a place I can share my thoughts, with you, and also keep you updated on the projects I am working on, have worked on, and of course share documentation (for the users, and for the contributors, for hacking of course).

## What I currently do üßë‚Äçüîß
:::note

This is basically a TL;DR for those who did not read the above text.

:::

1. Final year Engineering Student (with CS majors)
2. Work on open source projects, mainly around linux based operating systems
3. Make youtube videos on the same.

Some of my projects include, Arch Linux GUI, AgniOS, etc. You can find documentation for the same on left sidebar.
